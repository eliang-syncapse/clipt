usage: clipt.py [-h] {read,write,list,delete} [key] [value]

Save and retrieve text snippets from the command line.

Use this for:
	* fun
	* helping out with deploys (store shared text snippets, host names, commands)
	* ???

Requirements:
	* Python 3 (along with 2to3)
	* Nose (and coverage plugin) to run unittests and code coverage

Notes:
	* The local storage writer uses sqlite
	* Thrift interface for remote storage (not implemented)
	* Thrift doesn't support Python 3 so 2to3 is required (Makefile takes care of this)

Configuration:
	* Standard ini-file configuration, ~/.clipt/config
	* [main] section:
		* 'storage' => Which storage engine to use : {local, remote}
	* [local] section:
		* 'database' => Location of sqlite database : defaults to ~/.clipt/data
